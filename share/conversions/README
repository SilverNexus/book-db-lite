This folder contains the notation for schema upgrades to be parsed by
the converter in the lib/ folder (this folder's parent).
All upgrades are from old versions of the schema to the current version.

Syntax for conversions:
[Table] is the name of the table the field is in.
[Field] is the name of the field in the table.
[NewTable] is the name of another table for the data to be moved to.
[NewField] is the name of the field at its destination.

Lines starting with a "#" are considered comment lines and are ignored by the converter.

1. Move a field from one table to another
Table.Field -> NewTable.NewField
a. This can also be used to rename fields
Table.Field -> Table.NewField

2. Remove a field from the database
Table.Field -

3. Add a field to the database
Table.Field +

4. Compact data based on a set of fields in a table and cascade to any refrences
Table.(Field1, Field2, Field3, ... Fieldn) ^
